Analysis of Environmental Parameter Inference (p and l)
After a detailed review, it's clear the inference is a two-stage sequential process: first p is calculated, and then this result is used to infer l. This sequential approach has significant implications for the results.
1. Inference of Environmental Predictability (p_t)
My first key finding is that p_t is not inferred within the ssm_model.py script itself. Instead, it is calculated beforehand using a direct, frequentist method in the generate_vi_results.py script.
Methodology:
The calculate_p_t_series_frequentist function computes p_t for each timestep as the (population-weighted) fraction of agents that have positive income growth (y > 0).
Critique:
Point Estimate without Uncertainty: This approach yields a single point estimate for p_t at each timestep. It provides no measure of uncertainty. If there are few agents in a given timestep, this estimate could be very noisy, but this noise is not propagated into the subsequent estimation of l.
Sensitivity to Noise: The binary threshold (y > 0) is highly sensitive to noise. An agent with a growth rate of 0.001 is treated as a "win," while an agent with -0.001 is a "loss." This hard boundary can introduce variance, especially if many agents have growth rates near zero.
Missed Opportunity for a Bayesian Approach: A more robust method would be to model p_t within a Bayesian framework. For example, you could model the number of "wins" at each timestep with a Binomial distribution, placing a prior on p_t. This would naturally yield a full posterior distribution for p_t, capturing its uncertainty.
2. Inference of Environmental Payouts (l_t)
The parameter l_t is inferred within ssm_model.py using a "Best of Both Worlds" workflow that combines cross-sectional estimation with temporal smoothing.
Methodology (fit_l_cross_sectional):
Grid-Based Search: The model doesn't solve for l analytically. Instead, it defines a grid of possible l values (from 1.5 to 3.0) and evaluates the likelihood of the observed data for each value.
Core Assumption (The Critical Point): The entire inference for l hinges on a critical assumption: that at any given timestep, the distribution of agent beliefs (x) follows a fixed Beta distribution (hardcoded to be centered at 0.6 with a concentration of 3.0).
Likelihood Calculation: For a given y, p_t, and a test-value of l, the model calculates the implied agent belief x. It then computes how likely that x is under the assumed fixed Beta distribution. The l that makes the observed y values imply the most plausible set of x's is chosen.
Temporal Smoothing: The estimate_l_time_series_bayesian function runs this cross-sectional estimation for each timestep and then smooths the resulting time series of l_t estimates using a rolling average.
Critique:
Extremely Strong Assumption on Beliefs: The assumption that agent beliefs (x) follow a single, unchanging Beta distribution across all timesteps is the greatest vulnerability of this model. In a dynamic system where agents are supposed to be learning, their belief distribution should be changing. If the true distribution of x is different from this hardcoded prior, the estimate of l will be systematically biased.
Ignoring Temporal Structure: The model estimates l_t independently at each timestep, assuming no relationship between l_t and l_t-1. It then imposes temporal structure after the fact with a rolling average. A more principled Bayesian approach would be to define a temporal prior on l_t itself (e.g., l_t ~ Normal(l_t-1, sigma_l)), allowing the model to "borrow strength" across time during inference. This would be more robust, especially for timesteps with sparse or noisy data.
Error Propagation: The model uses the noisy point estimate of p_t as a fixed, true value when inferring l_t. This ignores the uncertainty in p_t, leading to overconfidence in the resulting estimate of l_t.
Statistical Formalism (Jacobian): The docstring explicitly notes that a Jacobian factor is omitted from the likelihood calculation. While done for pragmatic reasons, this means the model is not based on a formally correct probability distribution, making its statistical properties difficult to assess.
Summary and Recommendations
For a proof-of-concept focused on p and l, the current methodology has significant vulnerabilities that should be addressed.
The l inference is critically dependent on a strong, likely incorrect assumption about the static distribution of agent beliefs. This is the most important issue to address.
The sequential, point-estimate-based approach (calculating p_t then using it to find l_t) prevents a robust propagation of uncertainty.
To improve the inference for p and l, I recommend:
Model p_t Probabilistically: Replace the frequentist calculation with a simple Bayesian model (e.g., a Binomial likelihood for wins/losses) to get a posterior distribution for p_t, complete with uncertainty bounds.
Relax the Assumption on x: Instead of a fixed Beta prior on agent beliefs, consider a hierarchical approach where the parameters of the Beta distribution are themselves estimated from the data at each timestep.
Incorporate Temporal Priors: Model l_t (and potentially p_t) using a temporal prior like a Gaussian Random Walk. This would integrate smoothing into the inference process itself, making it more statistically robust than a post-hoc rolling average.
By addressing these points, you can build a much more reliable foundation for the environmental parameters, which will in turn allow for a more meaningful and accurate inference of agent-level beliefs (x) in the future.
